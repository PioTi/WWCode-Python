""" The Challenge
Author:
Description: Aling Nenaâ€™s Sari-sari store wants a robot that will ask the
customer their total bill and payment amount and tell them their change
(for now, we can allow negative change).
"""
bill = input(' How much is your total bill ? ')
payment = input(' How much is your payment ? ')
change = float(payment) - float(bill)
change = round(change,2)
print(f' Hi ! your change is {change}')
print(' Hi ! your change is {}'.format(change))
